### Open the esp123.ino file in the Arduino IDE, compile the code, and successfully upload it to the ESP32 microcontroller. Create a dedicated folder named temple and store the index.html file within it. Additionally, set up a separate folder named __pycache__ and place sensor_data.cpython-313.pyc inside it. Ensure that the exchangeable wire for the smart safety helmet is properly connected before proceeding.

	Software requirement: 
VS code: VS Code is a computer program where we write the code for our smart helmet's "brain" (ESP32). It helps us organize, write, and test the code to make our helmet work safely.

Arduino IDE: Arduino IDE is like a digital workshop! We use it to write instructions for the helmet's brain, telling it how to read sensors, sound alarms, and show info, keeping you safe!

	Hardware requirement:
ESP32 is like a tiny genius brain for smart devices! It reads data from sensors, processes it, and sends signals to perform tasks. With built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, it connects seamlessly to networks and other devices. This powerhouse enables real-time monitoring, efficient communication, and intelligent automation, making it a crucial component in modern gadgets like our smart helmet.

MQ2: The MQ2 is a special sensor that can "smell" different kinds of gases in the air. It's especially good at detecting gases like methane, smoke, and other harmful fumes. 
In places like coal mines, these gases can be very dangerous.   

HC-SR04: The HC-SR04 is a sound-wave ruler! It measures distance, like a bat's echo, so our helmet warns you about nearby obstacles.                 

DHT11:DHT11 is a tiny weather checker! It tells us the air's temperature and wetness, helping our helmet keep you comfy and safe.

LCD 16*2  I2C: A 16x2 LCD with I2C interface simplifies micro controller projects by displaying text. It saves GPIO pins, uses fewer-wires (SDA, SCL), and is perfect for compact displays in embedded systems.

Heart rate pulse: Heart rate pulse measures the number of heart beats per minute. It's used to monitor cardiovascular health, detect irregularities, and guide fitness training by ensuring optimal exercise intensity.                                     

MPU-6050: The MPU-6050 sensor in smart safety helmets for coal miners detects head movements and falls. It enhances safety by monitoring miners' orientation and alerting them to potential hazards                                                              

Data Exchangeable wire: Data exchangeable wires like Ethernet cables transmit digital information between devices. They ensure reliable communication, enabling seamless data transfer for monitoring, control, and automation in connected systems.

COM 5: A COM 5 port is a serial communication port used for connecting devices like modems, sensors, and micro controllers to a computer. It facilitates data exchange and device configuration
